# Bootstrap-Portfolio

11/18:
worked on index.html and style.css
created all components, just issues in terms of formatting
Tasks:
1. need to apply the font-family and colors to the navbar items or figure out why just applying those attributes to the headers doesn't work.
2. figure out why increasing the padding on the header (in order to create the desired look for the background on the name) is increasing the nav bar padding as well.
3. figure out what measurements should be used for the sections (taking the gaps between sections and margins into account and how that should affect column width).
4. style the rest of the page
5. figure out what the hell is up with the margins and why the navbar doesn't extend all the way.
6. then proceed to work on the contact and portfolio html pages.

Otherwise most of the work is laid out and making the rest of the website is easy once I solve the listed issues.
